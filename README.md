# Learn Organic Chemistry

This application is designed to help students of Organic Chemistry to learn the processes that facilitate chemical reactions. After choosing a reaction type (e.g. acid/base, substitution, elimination, ...), the user is given some reactant(s) and product(s) and will use arrow pushing to show the intermediates.

Arrows are drawn by simply dragging a finger across the screen. Each arrow must start on an atom or bond and end on another atom. The chemical compounds on the screen will change according to the arrows drawn by the user, who will continue drawing arrows until the desired product is achieved. Then the exercise is finished.
